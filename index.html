				<h2>Intro</h2>
				<p>
						When I was 14 years old, I got my first laptop. It was something for me to use on
					homework and various other projects for school so I didn't have to use my family desktop computer,
					that my parents used more than I did. So I got one for my birthday and I showed it to a 
					friend of mine. He asked if I had ever used the command window before, and proceeded to show me
					all of the useful and fun things you could do with batch files, that's the moment I was hooked.

				<h2>How I got into learning other languages</h2>
				<br>
				<p>
						After making several batch files to do various tasks, my longing for wanting to learn more was growing.
					I was very much into pc gmaing at this time, and always dreamed of making my own games that my friends and I
					could play. I did some research and found a few tutorials for unity on how to make simple walking simulators
					in a 3D space. Creating a virtual space that you are able to move around in that came from your own mind 
					is like a form of art. It was fascinating to me.<br><br>	Eventually I picked up another program called "Construct 2", 
					which is a program designed for making games and applications in an HTML5 enviroment. This was how I expressed myself,
					as I was never very good at art in general. I could just make a couple of sprites or grab free ones online and make animations
					within the editor, and within about an hour, I had made a playable game! My dream had almost come true.

				<h2>How all of this lead me to LC101</h2>
				<br>
				<p>
						In my senior year of highschool, it was time to start looking at colleges. There was a college fair, and I didn't know
					where to even start looking for a programming or game design class, but Full-Sail was there and it really caught my interest.
					Long story short, it ended up being far to expensive for me and I pursued going into electrical school to be an electrician.
					<br>
						I was still tinkering with different laguages at home in my free time to keep the interest alive and continued looking for
						somewhere I could apply my love of coding to the real world, as game design was not a very profitable route for me.
						I have a friend that is head of IT in a nearby company and he suggested Launch&nbsp;Code to me. I didn't know what
						languages I should learn that would be a good introduction for working at a company, but this was a sign that 
						it was what I needed to learn. This is the story from just getting a laptop at 14, until the time and reason you are 
						reading this, as to why I enjoy programming as a hobby.
